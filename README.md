## Guess N Learn

This games is based on Guess Who, but for language learning.

There will be 3 quiz modes:
- multiple choice (random from all questions)
- fill in the blank
- jumbled sentence

One will be able to upgrade (one-time small payment) to do other guessing games.

Ideas for guessing game alternatives:
- What is this person doing?
- What food is it?
- What is the time?
- What animal is it? https://shopping.rspb.org.uk/games/rspb-guess-who-game.html
